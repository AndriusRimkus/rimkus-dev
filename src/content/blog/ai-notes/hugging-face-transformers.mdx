I knew AI was more than LLMs and wrappers,
but scrolling through [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) left me overwhelmed pretty quickly.

This is me taking small (hopefully consistent) steps to get familiar with the landscape.

## New Python Project

Python has a great package and environment manager called [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
It feels like the good old npm. A few key commands:

```sh
uv init example
uv add transformers
uv add --dev ruff
uv run script.py
```

Same folks also made [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), which is basically ESLint and Prettier for Python:

```sh
ruff check
ruff format
```

## Running Transformers

I barely scratched the surface of the [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) library,
but with a little help from an LLM, here's a tiny script that runs sentiment analysis:

```py
from transformers import pipeline
from torch import cuda


def run():
    if cuda.is_available():
        device = f"GPU: {cuda.get_device_name(0)}"
    else:
        device = "CPU only"

    print(device)

    classifier = pipeline(
        "sentiment-analysis",
         # Hugging Face model
        model="distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english",
        # pinning model version
        revision="714eb0f",
    )

    sentences = [
        "My first experience with the transformers library.",
        "I might struggle with it at first.",
        "But let's proceed!",
    ]

    for text in sentences:
        result = classifier(text)[0]
        print(f"{text} - {result['label']} ({result['score']:.2%})")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

Output:

```
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650
Device set to use cuda:0
My first experience with the transformers library. - POSITIVE (90.80%)
I might struggle with it at first. - NEGATIVE (99.91%)
But let's proceed! - POSITIVE (99.34%)
```

## Next Steps

- Hugging Face recommends starting with their [LLM Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter0/1).
