## Memoization

Different from how Vue.js operates, React reexecutes Component function body on every render cycle.

Main re-render triggers include:

- Parent component re-renders
- State (useState) or props change
- Context value changes

### React Compiler

Latest React docs highly recommend using the [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) to optimize re-renders automatically.
That allows basically forgetting about memoization in vast majority of cases.

### React.memo

Outputs a higher-order component which skips re-rendering when the parent re-renders, given the props are the same (shallow comparison).

```tsx
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ name }) {
    return <div>Hello, {name}</div>;
});
```

### useMemo()

A React hook producing a memoized value. Recomputes the value only when one of the dependencies change.
Often used together with React.memo.

```tsx
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
    return computeExpensiveValue(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```

### useCallback()

Caches a function definition between re-renders. It does not execute the function.
It's syntactic sugar for useMemo when the memoized value is a function.

```tsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```
